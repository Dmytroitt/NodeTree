# ðŸŒ³ Directory Tree Generator

A simple Node.js script to generate a directory tree.

## Usage

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository or download the code.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script with the following command:

```shell
node tree.js [directory] [includeFiles]
```

- `[directory]`: The path to the directory you want to show the tree for. If not provided, the current directory will be used.
- `[includeFiles]`: (Optional) Indicates whether to include files in the directories. Use `true` to include files, omit this argument or use `false` to exclude files.

Example:

```shell
node tree.js /Users/ true
```

The above command will display the tree for the specified directory, including files.

If you need help or more information, run the script with the `help` or `h` argument:

```shell
node tree.js help
```
